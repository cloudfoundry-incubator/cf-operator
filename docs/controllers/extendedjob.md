## Description

An `ExtendedJob` allows the developer to run jobs when something interesting happens. It also allows the developer to store the output of the job into a `Secret`.
The job started by an `ExtendedJob` is deleted automatically after it succeeds.

There are three different kinds of `ExtendedJob`:

- **triggered jobs**: a job is created when an event occurs (e.g. a pod is created)
- **one-offs**: automatically runs once after it's created
- **errands**: needs to be run manually by a user

## Features

### Triggered Jobs

An `ExtendedJob` can be triggered when something interesting happens to a pod.

E.g. when a `Pod` is created, deleted, transitioned to **ready** or a
**notReady** state.

The execution of `ExtendedJob` can be limited to pods with certain labels.

A separate native k8s `Job` is started for every pod that changes. The `Job`
has a label `fissile.cloudfoundry.org/triggering-pod: uid` to identify which pod it is running for.

`ExtendedJob` does not trigger for pods from other `Jobs`. This is done by checking if
a pod has a label `job-name`. The `job-name` label is [assigned by Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/) to `Job` `Pods`.

#### State

The `when` trigger can be used to run a `Job` when the state of a `Pod` changes.
Possible values are `ready`, `notready`, `created` and `deleted`.

The `when` field is required for triggered jobs.

Look [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-operator/blob/master/docs/examples/extended-job/exjob_trigger_ready.yaml) for a full example that uses this type of trigger.

#### Labels

The `selector` trigger can be used run a `Job` for pods with a matching label.
It supports matching against a list of labels via `matchLabels`.
It can also match by expressions if `matchExpressions` are given.

If multiple selectors are given, all must match to include the pod.

Look [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-operator/blob/master/docs/examples/extended-job/exjob_trigger_ready.yaml) for a full example that uses this type of selector.

### Errand Jobs

Errands are run manually by the user. They are created by setting `trigger.strategy: manual`.

After the `ExtendedJob` is created, run an errand by editing and applying the
manifest, i.e. via `k edit errand1` and change `trigger.strategy: manual` to `trigger.strategy: now`. A `kubectl patch` is also a good way to trigger this type of `ExtendedJob`.

After completion, this value is reset to `manual`.

Look [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-operator/blob/master/docs/examples/extended-job/exjob_errand.yaml) for a full example of an errand.

### One-Off Jobs / Auto-Errands

One-off jobs run directly when created, just like native k8s jobs.

They are created with `trigger.strategy: once` and switch to `done` when
finished.

#### Restarting on Config Change

Just like an `ExtendedStatefulSet`, a **one-off** `ExtendedJob` can
automatically be restarted if its environment/mounts have changed, due to a
`ConfigMap` or a `Secret` being updated. This also works for [Versioned Secrets](#versioned-secrets).

This requires the attribute `updateOnConfigChange` to be set to true.

Once `updateOnConfigChange` is enabled, modifying the `data` of any `ConfigMap` or `Secret` referenced by the `template` section of the job will trigger the job again.

### Persisted Output

The developer can specify a `Secret` where the standard output/error output of
the `ExtendedJob` is stored.

One secret is created or overwritten per container in the pod. The secrets'
names are `<namePrefix>-<containerName>`.

The only supported output type currently is json with a flat structure, i.e.
all values being string values.

**Note:** Output of previous runs is overwritten.

The behavior of storing the output is controlled by specifying the following parameters:

- `namePrefix` - Prefix for the name of the secret(s) that will hold the output.
- `outputType` - Currently only `json` is supported. (default: `json`)
- `secretLabels` - An optional map of labels which will be attached to the generated secret(s)
- `writeOnFailure` - if true, output is written even though the Job failed. (default: `false`)
- `versioned` - if true, the output is written in a [Versioned Secret](#versioned-secrets)

#### Versioned Secrets

Versioned Secrets are a set of `Secrets`, where each of them is immutable, and contains data for one iteration. Implementation can be found in the [versionedsecretstore](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-operator/blob/master/pkg/kube/util/versionedsecretstore) package.

When an `ExtendedJob` is configured to save to "Versioned Secrets", the controller looks for the `Secret` with the largest ordinal, adds `1` to that value, and _creates a new Secret_.

Each versioned secret has the following characteristics:

- its name is calculated like this: `<name>-v<ORDINAL>` e.g. `mysecret-v2`
- it has the following labels:
  - `fissile.cloudfoundry.org/secret-kind` with a value of `versionedSecret`
  - `fissile.cloudfoundry.org/secret-version` with a value set to the `ordinal` of the secret
- an annotation of `fissile.cloudfoundry.org/source-description` that contains arbitrary information about the creator of the secret
