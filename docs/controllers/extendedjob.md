## Description

An `ExtendedJob` allows the developer to run jobs when something interesting happens. It also allows the developer to store the output of the job into a `ConfigMap` or `Secret`.

Just like an `ExtendedStatefulSet`, an `ExtendedJob` can automatically be restarted if its environment/mounts have changed due to a `ConfigMap` or a `Secret` being updated.

There are three different kinds of `ExtendedJob`: triggered jobs, one-offs and
errands.

## Features

### Triggered Jobs

An `ExtendedJob` can be triggered when something interesting happens to a pod.

E.g. when a `Pod` is created, deleted, transitioned to **ready** or a
**notReady** state.

The execution of `ExtendedJob` can be limited to pods with certain labels.

A separate native k8s job will be started for every pod that changed. The job
has a label `affected-pod: pod1` to identify which pod it is running for.

`ExtendedJob` does not trigger for pods from jobs. If a pod has a label `job-name` it won't trigger more jobs.

#### State

To trigger on the state of the pod, the `when` trigger can be used.
Possible values are `ready`, `notready`, `created` and `deleted`.

The `when` field is required for triggered jobs.

Example: `when: ready`

#### Labels

To trigger on pods with a matching label, the `selector` trigger can be used.
It supports matching against a list of labels via `matchLabels`.
It can also match by expressions if `matchExpressions` are given.

If multiple selectors are given, all must match to include the pod.

### Errand Jobs

Errands are manually run by the user.

They can't have a `triggers` section and specify `run: manually` instead.

After the `ExtendedJob` is created, run an errand by editing and applying the
manifest, i.e. via `k edit errand1` and change `run: manually` to `run: now`,
after completion the value will be reset to `manually`.

### One-Off Jobs / Auto-Errands

One-off jobs run directly when created, just like native k8s jobs, but still
persist their output.

They can't have a `triggers` section and specify `run: once` instead.

### Persisted Output

The developer can specify a Secret where the standard output/error output of
the ExtendedJob is stored. Only single-pod jobs are supported when output
persistence is enabled for now.

One secret is created or overwritten per container in the pod. The secrets'
names are `<namePrefix><container-name>`

The only supported output type currently is json with a flat structure, i.e.
all values being string values.

**Note:** Output of previous runs will be overwritten.

The behavior of storing the output is controlled by specifying the following parameters:

- `namePrefix` - Prefix for the name of the secret(s) that will hold the output.
- `outputType` - Currently only `json` is supported. (default: `json`)
- `secretLabels` - An optional map of labels which will be attached to the generated secret(s)
- `writeOnFailure` - if true, output is written even though the Job failed. (default: `false`)
